Subject: [Mstring-coredev] About commit and mails
Message-ID: <486A9E0B.2070803@gmail.com>

Hello folks,
Berlios doesn't allow to setup automatic emailing to maillist on every 
made commit.
But it can be really useful.
In this case I decide the following - in case of not so often commits 
everybody can write an email to the maillist, like usually I've decided 
to make a standart style - the first - there email can be filtered via 
regular expressions, the second - everybody will know about commit and 
changes.
So on - the rules:
Subject: *commit* /modulename/ subjectofcommit
Body: ... ... ... Files added
... ... ... Files changed
... ... ... Files deleted
Comments on this.

So, information about changed/deleted/added files you can take while you 
make commit.

I will made a commit soon, it will be like example.

Anyway, if you have questions or suggestions - you are welcome.

Thanks and have a nice day/evening/night. ;)

Subject: [Mstring-coredev] *commit* /MuiString/ added binary buddy
	abstraction
Message-ID: <486AC5D6.2010107@gmail.com>

Modified Files:       
    Makefile include/eza/amd64/types.h       
Added Files:       
    include/mm/bbuddy.h mm/Makefile.inc mm/bbuddy.c 

It's initial implementation - it works, tested, but I will add some 
checking later, and optimize it, I write this quickly and in this case 
I've forgot made some checking...
Anyway, it will be stress tested later in microkernel.
