Subject: [Mstring-coredev] Documentation update - new structure
Message-ID: <483B3669.3090905@gmail.com>

Hello folks,
I've created a draft with new specification of the microkernel and it's 
structure.

You can find this document via this link - 
http://mstring.berlios.de/wiki/doku.php?id=muistring_structure

This is a new (and really first!) specification on the microkernel 
architecture and specification that fully accepted by my wide of  the 
microkernel design architecture.

Using my maintainer and project founder rights - I'm requere to follow 
this specification during the development process.

It's a finished solution, this draft will be updated soon for other parts.

In addition - I', creating a skel for this - all development must be 
moved out from mkernel module to new one MuiString.

I'm ready for comments and flame here, you are welcome ;)

PS some later I will commit my own source code for one of the 
architecture platform - it will be something like example. I'm worried 
about development speed, and I want to grow up it ...
PPS I don't like low-level development in this case.

Thank you.
