Subject: [Mstring-coredev] Current progress
Message-ID: <484F917F.7050207@gmail.com>

Hello folks,

I will report now in this mail about current progress.
There are a good news from my microkernel sandbox ;)
I've tested all initialization and paging - all is works , some of my 
works already committed to the `MuiString' repository.
EZA API is now under process and will be ready soon as possible (depends 
on my time) and it will be well documented like usually - it will be a 
signal to make other ports.
Overally - my sandbox under heavy development stage and I need to 
test/implement the following
 - Memory Manager (partly implemented)
 - Virtual Memory Manager
 - Scheduler (partly implemented)
 - IPC with driver hooks and interfaces
 - NS
There are no so long stage in the case that kernel binary built and 
works well.
Also I will create some later a new repository with testing microkernel 
servers - just for tests - after this stage we're can slowly switch to 
more sweet stage - servers and drivers with system libs(it's area of 
other project).
I'm planning to make all this job within 2-3 month (assume - september 
is a deadline) - also I want core team to help with development, bug 
fixing and porting to other architectures.
If you have questions on current stage and questions about source code - 
mail here.

thanks and have a nice day.

Hello,

Ah ... that is bad news indeed. I didn't know that you were trying to get a
sponsorship for the project.

Yes, I've a plan for it - it was a fantastic scheme - there are was 
financing for all dev team ... but now I can said that it's failed ;(

Anyway, don't be sad - we're need to make all stuff - it's good for 
brains - and it's a good project to show your potential employer ... I 
think ...

I'm ok - and I get ready to continue development on project today ;) 
it's a good news I think ....

Subject: [Mstring-coredev] AMD64 specific SMPchanges
Message-ID: <485D102A.70504@gmail.com>

Hello folks,
today I've added initial SMP support to amd64 port (not at all, just 
basic init and spinlock's code).

If you are working on MuiString repository - please be updated, I will 
commit many things soon that SMP related.

Also, for your interest - or maybe for general information and better 
understanding of amd64 bootstrap specific I wrote small doc - look it 
here - http://0xffffffc0h.blogspot.com/2008/06/amd64-1-long-mode.html - 
this is my blog - I will write there many technical stuff.

Thanks, if any comments or questions - please write here.

Hello,

When I do a make in the root project directory of MuiString then I get the
following messages :

[root at rohit-laptop MuiString]# make
[CC] eza/generic_api/main.c
eza/generic_api/main.c:1: error: code model 'kernel' not supported in the 32
bit mode
eza/generic_api/main.c:1: sorry, unimplemented: 64-bit mode not compiled in

My config and Makefile.inc are default, I haven't made any changes to them.

Let me know how to get around this problem

It's a problem of your compiler and binutils - you need amd64 port.
In this case I can recommend you to do the following -
download gcc and binutils - compile it for target amd64 and make changes 
to Makefile.inc  - so, I can minimize your headache - there are two 
files in attachments - the shell script will do all stuff for amd64 gcc 
and binutils (run as root) - and Makefile.inc - that you need.

If paths is not correct in Makefile.inc - correct it with right ones.

Thanks.

Subject: [Mstring-coredev] Virtual memory design - free microkernel from
	possible bugs ...
Message-ID: <48603696.2070700@gmail.com>

Hello folks,
today I'm thinking about overall design of virtual memory in the 
MuiString based OS.
I've made some simulation and research - here it my post about it - 
http://0xffffffc0h.blogspot.com/2008/06/muistring-higher-memory-management.html
Discussing are highly welcome.

Thanks.

Subject: [Mstring-coredev] Help needed for booting the MuiString kernel in
	bochs
Message-ID: <cc8e457e0806261434h2d0217f7gc39191cf66513a11@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have done the bochs set-up same as mentioned in the wiki file. But I
couldn't find how to link the MuiString (vmuielf) kernel binary and use it
to boot in bochs.
How should I go about doing this?

When, I mount the images as a loop back device on a $MOUNT_POINT and then
try to install grub on it. I am unable to do it.

Following is the output of the gurb prompt :
    GNU GRUB  version 0.97  (640K lower / 3072K upper memory)

 [ Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported.  For the first word, TAB
   lists possible command completions.  Anywhere else TAB lists the possible
   completions of a device/filename.]

grub> device (fd0) /dev/loop0

grub> root (fd0)Unknown partition table signature
 Filesystem type is ext2fs, using whole disk

grub> setup (fd0)
 Checking if "/boot/grub/stage1" exists... no
 Checking if "/grub/stage1" exists... no

Error 15: File not found

---------------------------------
Following is my bochsrc file :
cpu: count=1
megs: 32
#floppya: 1_44=/mnt/c/jari-boot/boot.img, status=inserted
ata0-master type=disk, path="/mnt/c/jari-boot/boot.img", mode=flat,

boot: floppy
romimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest

Subject: [Mstring-coredev] Added EmuStartKit ...
Message-ID: <4864EE1C.8060809@gmail.com>

Hello folks,
Today I've decided to make a contribution to make help with project 
development.
There are many tricks with installing grub to hard disk image file, and 
I didn't get anything of them works.
I've made an hard disk image (working on bochs and qemu) with installed 
grub, and I've add an entry to the menu.lst to make all processes making 
simple.
Disk image is made with 256Mb size ext2 fs (I'm planning to develop a 
microkernel server that will works with ext2 filesystem first).
Also, there are useful script that will simply copying compiled kernel 
to the image.
So - you can download it here - 
http://prdownload.berlios.de/mstring/emustartkit-1.0.tar.bz2 (~511Kb)
In this tarball you will find hd0.img.bz2 - after decompressing it will 
takes 256Mb, and script - in this script you chould change the path of 
your sandbox sources - this is all.
In addition - here my ~/.bochsrc that works with this image:

    cpu:
    count=1                                                                                                               

    megs:
    32                                                                                                                   

    floppya: 1_44=/usr/lib/grub-rescue/grub-rescue-floppy.img,
    status=inserted                                                 
    ata0-master: type=disk,
    path="/home/tirra/works/Jari/m-spring/emu/hd0.img", mode=flat,
    cylinders=520, heads=16, spt=63     
    boot:
    disk                                                                                                                 

    romimage:
    file=/usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest                                                                          

    vgaromimage: /usr/share/vgabios/vgabios.bin

On this image you will find built vmuielf image.

Thanks and happy development.
